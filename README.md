When you're short on time but your home project must get done, get help from skilled people in your community or become part of the Chore Squad and put your skills to work and get paid doing what you're good at.


## How it works:

Whether you're looking for someone with specific skills to help complete your next project or just looking to earn extra income by putting your skills to work, Choresquad connects you with members from your community who can help you achieve your next goal. Similar to other popular location-based social networking apps, Choresquad's interactive map displays a marker icon identifying a user's location that when selected, highlights their profile which includes their photo, a short bio of what they're looking for (looking for help or offering their services), their social media handles and any skills they're proud of (for users looking to offer their services). Users can exchange messages with potential matches and make arrangements to fulfill each other's needs on the platform.
